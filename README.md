# Project Overview

For this project, I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. Originally, [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) was already included, as well the first test suite.
My goal was to implement the remaining test suites found in the [Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/3442558598/rubric).

## How to run the application:

* Download or clone the repository and open the index.html file in your browser.
* Click the menu icon to change feeds.
* At the bottom of the page, all tests should pass in the Jasmine spec reporter.
